## 🦇 About <a name = "about"></a>



A hosted version of this project is [available online here](https://wren-nc-news-frontend.vercel.app/articles).

It is built on top of [a backend API project](https://github.com/smlbrd/wren-nc-news-api/blob/main/README.md).

Clicking the link above will take you to a directory describing the endpoints accepted by the API, along with examples of accepted queries and typical responses.
**Please be patient, as it can take a minute or two to spin up for the first time!**
